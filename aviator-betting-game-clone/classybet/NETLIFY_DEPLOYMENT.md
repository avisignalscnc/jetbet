## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Login Returns 500 Error

**Check:**
1. Backend API health: https://aviator-casino.vercel.app/health
2. Vercel function logs (Dashboard → Deployments → View Function Logs)
3. MongoDB connection string is correct
4. Environment variables are set

**Fix:**
- Verify MONGODB_URI includes database name
- Check MongoDB Atlas allows connections from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
- Ensure JWT_SECRET is set
- Redeploy Vercel after adding environment variables

### Issue: CORS Errors

**Fix:** Update backend CORS in `api/index.js`:
```javascript
app.use(cors({
    origin: ['https://JetBet.netlify.app', 'http://localhost:3000'],
    credentials: true
}));
```

### Issue: Assets Not Loading (404)

**Fix:**
- Check file paths are relative
- Verify netlify.toml is in JetBet folder
- Check Base directory setting in Netlify

### Issue: Page Refresh Shows 404

**Fix:**
- Verify netlify.toml redirects are configured
- Should have: `from = "/*"` redirect to `"/index.html"`

## 🎯 Quick Commands

curl https://aviator-casino.vercel.app/health
